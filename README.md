# Civic Elevator Code Challenges

This repository holds the code challenges (a.k.a "homework assignments") that Civic Elevator uses as part of its hiring process.

Interested applicants should [apply to an open position on Workable](https://apply.workable.com/civic-elevator/) first before completing a code challenge.

## Challenges

1. [Engineering](./eng/README.md): fetch a JSON payload from an API and render it inside a web page.
2. [User Experience](./ux/README.md): create a wireframe for a dashboard.

## General Notes

We use code challenges as a means for candidates to demonstrate their skills and strengths on their own terms, and their own time. Used in conjunction with interviews, the challenges can provide a complete view of a candidate, moreso than portfolio reviews or measuring public offerings on Github.

The challenges are designed to be small – only taking a couple of hours – and respectful of the candidates. They are not spec work, nor are they a sneaky means for Civic Elevator to garner free work.

Civic Elevator will evaluate responses based on a common rubric, and each submission will receive at least two reviews.

Any candidate with questions about the challenges, or Civic Elevator's hiring process in general, should contact us at `recruiting@civicelevator.com`.
