# Civic Elevator Status Page

Your task is to design a status dashboard for a system that has three components:

- web application that displays weather alerts
- third-party data source that the application reads from on a 30 minute interval
- backend data processing and analytics services

Each component operates independently from the others, and can exist in one of three states: available, degraded, or unavailable.

We've conducted a small amount of user research among potential users, and they've identified these features as ones they would find valuable:

- subscribe to alerts when any component changes from "available" to another state
- share a link to an incident (an incident is a specific instance where a component is not in the "available" state)
- see the historical data related to the performance of a component
- get an alert for planned maintenance activities

In the course of our research, users suggested we review existing status page implementations like:

- [Dropbox Status](https://status.dropbox.com/)
- [G Suite Status Dashboard](https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&v=status_)
- [Pingdom Map](https://livemap.pingdom.com/)

## Deliverable

You should create the following:

1. A one or more rough wireframes showing the components of the status page, their layout, and relationship to each other. Please call out any interactivity or other affordances.
2. A written description of your work, including a list of metrics you would use to analyze the performance of the dashboard, and 2 or 3 ideas you'd like to test with real users.

You may use any tool – paper and pencil, Figma, Sketch, Moqups, Illustrator, etc. – that you prefer to create the wireframe, so long as you submit the final result as a PDF. The written description should not be more than one page or 500 words.

## Notes

If you have questions about the exercise, please email `recruiting@civicelevator.com`. We'll respond as quickly as we can.

You are welcome to spend as much time on this as you want; however, our intention with this is not to see a perfect, production-ready design. We're looking for evidence that you know how to interpret a feature description, can follow directions, and make intelligent decisions when given the opportunity. You should be able to complete this within the span of a few hours.

We will evaluate your response based on a rubric that assesses:

- correctness (did you complete the task as described?)
- critical thinking (does the result demonstrate understanding of the task?)
- quality (is the written response coherent? does the wireframe convey a clear solution?)

## Submission

Email your wireframes and written response as a single PDF file to `recruiting@civicelevator.com` with the subject line: "Homework - UX Designer - Your Name", with "Your Name" replaced with your first and last names.
