        "description": "All eyes are on Laura in the Gulf, as she is forecast to landfall\nnear the Louisiana and Texas border area Wednesday night. We'll\nthen see her tropical remnants move toward us, with the best\nchance of her heaviest rains incoming during the Thursday night\nthrough Friday night, into early Saturday, time period.\n\nCurrent storm total rainfall projections suggest we could get\nlocalized 3 plus inches broadly across our south by this weekend,\nwith lesser amounts ranging north. Keep in mind that locally\nheavier rains could occur, especially given the tropical nature of\nthis system. Flooding issues may result.\n\nIn addition, there is a lot of question to the forecast beyond\nLaura's departure this weekend. Still lingering high humidity\nmeans that daily storm pop ups remain in the forecast, and they\nwill include the chance for locally heavy rainfall. Another inch\nor two on top of Laura's predecessor rains, will only heighten or\naggravate any potential flooding issues.\n\nPlan accordingly for this late week wet period, and keep an eye on\nrising waters and travel routes with this heavy rain impact hazard\nincluded in your plans.",
